## LED Blink Revisited
Made an LED blink, and then fade in and out repeatedly. Reflection: Coding the Serial Print to print out x's according to the brightness of the LED was hard at first but as I remembered how to create a Serial Print Line, I eventually correctly coded the Serial Print.
## helloLCD
Wired up an LCD screen to print a message. Reflection: The first time I soldered the pins, I connected multiple pins. However, I melted the solder and tried again. The second time, I correctly soldered the pins.

## LCD Backpack
Attached an LCD Backpack to an LCD to reduce the number of wires required to print a message. Then, a button was added and the number of times the button was pressed was counted and displayed on the LCD screen. Reflection: The coding for the button was hard at first, but eventually (with some help) I correctly coded and wired the button.
## Photointerrupter
Wired a photointerrupter that detected when something passed between its legs and turned on a LED, and then tracked how many times something passed thorugh the legs. Reflection: I had some trouble correclty soldering the wires at first, but I eventually soldered them correctly, and, after figuring out the wiring, got the circuit running.
## Potentiometers
Wired a potetniometer to control an LED and portray its values on an LCD screen. Reflection: Making the potentiometer display its numerical value on the LCD screen seemed complicated at first, but I figured it out. 
## Motor Control
Used a motor to control a potetniometer, along with a diode and transistor. Reflection: I originally placed the diode the wrong way, and multiple motors failed, so the circuit did not work. After replacing various parts multiple times, the circuit was corrected and ran.
